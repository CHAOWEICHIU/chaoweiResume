		What should rethink robotic do in China?
	</p>
	<p class="comment-content">
		<strong>Partnership</strong><br>
		It is very important to partner with at least one local firm in order to ... <br><br>
		(1)<br>
		Understand manufacturing environment in China and deal with surprises easily by using the help from local firm.<br><br>
		(2)<br>
		Have up-to-date regulation information in order to have More time to focus on customer service instead of keep dealing with complex regulations.<br><br>
		(3)<br>
		Accommodate the fact that China is at the stage that has enough capacity to build its own vampire with its accumulated asset (people, money and skills). It leads to a situation where more than 75% of foreign businesses are less welcome than before in China.<br><br><br>

		This leads to a question that what local firm that rethink robotics should partner with?
