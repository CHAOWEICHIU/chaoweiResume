		What Should Rethink Robotics do in China?
	</p>
	<p class="comment-content">
		There are plenty of robotic companies that have come and gone in the past 20 years. It is a little bit late if a company just thought about getting into this industry. However, a company still can have a share with proper marketing and business strategy based on up-to-date information.

		Why industrial Robot?
	</p>
	<p class="comment-content">
		<strong>Manufacturing Plant Booming</strong>
		<br>
		Government mandates and political encouragement to develop the industry domestically and ultimately to export product with low-cost loans and factory property incentives. Also, serious investment in automation and robotics from companies such as Foxconn and Apple that manufacture their goods in China. 
		<br><br>
		<strong>But ... why not people?</strong>
		<br>
		There are three segments in this discussion. Firstly, wage increases rapidly every year. Secondly, a rapidly aging work force is hampered by the one-child policy of past regimes and diminishing factory-age work force. Last but not least, the high cost of training and housing for a short-term transient work force.

		What Marketing Strategy?
	</p>
	<p class="comment-content">
		<strong>Three Types of Clients</strong><br>
		There are 
		<strong><u>cost</u></strong>,
		<strong><u>comprehensive service</u></strong>, and
		<strong><u>specialty</u></strong> types of clients in China. Each company tends to target its own type of clients based on its own capacity, ability and resources in the robotics industry.

		What Business Strategy?
	</p>
	<p class="comment-content">
		<strong>Localization</strong>
		<br>
		Localization is used because there are many National policies implemented that might significantly affect a foreign enterprise’s business without advanced warning. Also, cultural differences would affect how the first line workers operate a company’s robot. Therefore, I think it is very important to hire a <u><strong><a href="/resume" style="font-size:30px;">person</a></strong></u> who has plant-manufacturing experience in China and is able to speak English and Mandarin. If the company lacks an employee with these skills, it should partnership with another local robotics company.
