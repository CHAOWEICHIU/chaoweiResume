		What Should Rethink Robot do in China?
	</p>
	<p class="comment-content">
		There are plenty of robotic companies come and go in the past 20 years. It is a little bit late if a company just thought about getting into in industry. However, a company still can have a share with proper marketing and business strategy base on the up-to-date information.

		Why industrial Robot?
	</p>
	<p class="comment-content">
		<strong>Manufacturing Plant Booming</strong>
		<br>
		Government mandates and political encouragement to develop the industry domestically and ultimately to export product with low-cost loans and factory property incentives. Also, serious investment in automation and robotics from companies such as Foxconn and Apple that manufacture their goods in China. 
		<br><br>
		<strong>But .... why not people?</strong>
		<br>
		There are three segments in this discussion. Firstly, wage increases rapidly every year. Secondly, a rapidly age work force hampered by the one-child policy of past regimes and diminishing factory-age work force. Last but not least, high cost of training and housing for a short-term transient work force.

		What Business Strategy?
	</p>
	<p class="comment-content">
		<strong>Localization</strong>
		<br>
		The reason is because there are many National policy would be implemented that might significantly affect company’s business without warning foreign enterprise in advance. Also, culture difference would affect how the first line workers operates company’s robot. Therefore, I think it is very important to hire a 
		<strong><a href="" style="font-size:15px; background-color:yellow;">person</a></strong>
		who has plant-manufacturing experience in China and be able to speak English and Mandarin. Or company should partnership with local robotics company.
